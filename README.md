# rook-vs-bishop

We are looking at a 'special' game of chess where each player only has one piece.
Player with white pieces only has a bishop while player with black pieces only has a
rook.

- In chess, the columns (called Files) are denoted as alphabets(a-h) and rows
(called Ranks) are denoted as numbers (1-8).
- Any given square is a combination of file and rank. In the above figure the
position of bishop is c3 while that of the rook is f6.
- Bishop only moves diagonally from its position, in all 4 directions (top-right,
top-left, bottom-right, bottom-left).
- Rook moves either vertically (up and down) or horizontally (left and right) from
its given position.
- Both rook and bishop can capture one another only if the other piece falls in
the valid motion path.

## Set Up

In the object-oriented language of your choosing
1. Create classes/objects for the two pieces
2. Create an appropriate representation of board state
3. Given a board state, write code to determine whether the rook can capture the
bishop.
4. Write code to determine whether the bishop can capture the rook.



## The Problem
We decide to move the black rook and play for its survival. The move happens as
follows:
1. Toss a coin, if it's heads, the rook moves up. If it's tails, the rook moves to the
right.
2. Roll 2 dice (6 sided). The sum of numbers on the face up side of both the dice
will be the number of squares the rook moves.
3. If the rook reaches the right most column on the board, it emerges again from the
left most column.
4. If the rook reaches the top most row, it emerges again from the bottom most row.
    - Move the rook as described above for 15 rounds. If it manages to survive
    from being captured by the bishop, the player with the rook wins. Else the
    player with bishop wins.
    - The starting position for rook is h1 square and bishop remains stationary
    on c3.


## Bishop Play Rules
It's Rook Vs Bishop in this Game! Both players move using a combination of coins/die.

The Rook move happens first as follows: 
1. Toss a coin, if it's heads, the rook moves up. If it's tails, the rook moves to the
right.
2. Roll 2 dice (6 sided). The sum of numbers on the face up side of both the dice
will be the number of squares the rook moves.
3. If the rook reaches the right most column on the board, it emerges again from the
left most column.
4. If the rook reaches the top most row, it emerges again from the bottom most row.

The Bishop move happens next: 
1. Roll a speical 4 way die to determine the direction that the bishop will move in. 
2. Roll 2 dice (6 sided). The sum of numbers on the face up side of both the dice
will be the number of squares the bishop moves.
3. If the Bishop reaches the edge of the board, it emerges again from the opposite side.

The Rook and Bishop take turns until someone has won, or all 15 turn are up. 


## Task
Write code to determine which player won, given the above constraints. Make sure to
record (or print) the result of coin toss, dice and rook's position after every move.
Additionally, please document any assumptions you made that influenced your solution.
We have intentionally framed this problem to give you latitude in how you solve it, so it’s
useful to understand your interpretation of the problem.

## How to Play

To play, in the directory, run ```go run main.go```

## Improvements

- board size and number of rounds should be dynamic, this would require user input.
- add more tests
- a nicer UI
